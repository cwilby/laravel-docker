# Laravel Docker

This is a minimal Node.js script that uses [commander]() and [inquiry]() to ask setup questions and use [nunjucks]() to generate the files needed to run Laravel on Docker in a local environment.

It's what I use to start new Laravel projects - just posting if anybody finds it useful.

## Usage

`node . init <laravel_directory>`
